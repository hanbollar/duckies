# Duckies ðŸ¦†

### Focus

Focus was to demonstrate the use of an interesting shader within a scene-like environment.

Used voronoi time-based mix for interactive water covering alongside 3D multi-octave noise specifically for the time-based vertex displacement.

### Description

Welcome to Ducky's day off as he enjoys his time in the outdoor blow-up pool with his other duck toys.
